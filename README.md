Building it yourself
============

You can *try* to build it yourself with the ant script, but you would probably have to extensively change your workspace and/or the build script to fit. I claim **NO RESPONSIBILITY** for any potential errors or quirks that may arise. There really isn't that much of a need for you to build it yourself because the provided [link](http://mods.austin-jones.info/builds/arsherbologica/) up above gets them straight from Jenkins. Deobfuscated jars are also available.
