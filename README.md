Building it yourself
============

You can *try* to build it yourself with the ant script, but you would probably have to extensively change your workspace and/or the build script to fit. I claim **NO RESPONSIBILITY** for any potential errors or quirks that may arise. There really isn't that much of a need for you to build it yourself because the provided [link](http://mods.austin-jones.info/builds/arsherbologica/) up above gets them straight from Jenkins. Deobfuscated jars are also available.

Roadmap
============

## First Release (0.1.xx, ~September/October)

*Fruits, Berries and Vegetables* All edible plant items, basically, with crop versions of each. (Oranges, Strawberries, etc.)

*Utility Plants* Plant items and their crops whose raw forms are not immediately edible. (Vanilla, Coffee, etc.)

*Basic Mod Interoperability* Compatibility with other mods, where it makes sense. (I'll add fruit trees into Forestry farms, but not add facades for berry bushes.)

## Advanced Mechanics (0.2-9.xx, ~December/January-June/July)

*Cross-breeding Plants* This is where the science and research parts come into play.

*Miscellaneous Machines* Stuff like the coffee maker and brewery.
